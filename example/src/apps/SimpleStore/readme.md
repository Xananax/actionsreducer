# Super Simple Store

This is a fairly short and quick implementation of a todo store, yet it allows quite some refinements.

Try:

 - adding a todo by pressing enter
 - checking the checkbox to mark a todo as done
 - double-click a todo to edit it
 - reorder todos by clicking on the up and down arrows
 - deleting a todo by clicking the `x`
 - nest a todo by clicking the right arrow
