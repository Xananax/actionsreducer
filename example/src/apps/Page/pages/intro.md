# ActionReducer

You'll find here examples of what `ActionsReducer` can do.

All examples are accompanied with the original source code for their respective store, but no source for the elements and other utilities, for brevity.

The full source code of the [examples](https://github.com/Xananax/actionsreducer/tree/master/example) can be found in the [github repo](https://github.com/Xananax/actionsreducer/).

If you have the [redux devtool extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension), you can observe the state changing there; 
if not, an integrated [redux-devtools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) should pop up (hide it with `ctrl-h`).
