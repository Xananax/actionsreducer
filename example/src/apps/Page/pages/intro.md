# ActionReducer

This is an example of what Actionsreducers can do.

You'll find several examples, with source code.

The full source code of the example can be found in the [github repo](https://github.com/Xananax/actionsreducer/tree/master/example).

If you have the [redux devtool extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension), you can observe the state changing there; if not, an integrated [redux-devtools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) should pop up (hide it with `ctrl-g`).

Happy testing!
