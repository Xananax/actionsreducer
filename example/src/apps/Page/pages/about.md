Thanks & Inspirations:

  - [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon/) for [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
  - [Evan Czaplicki](https://github.com/evancz) for [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) and all the talks
  - [Lea Verou](http://lea.verou.me/) for [Prism.js](http://prismjs.com/) and an uncountable number of tips and good advice
  - Too many starter packs and repositories to list here or remember
  - The programmer's community in general. They can be self-righteous or overly squabbling or plain PITAs at times, but more often than not, it's the most non-competitive and genuinely helpful group of humans I've had the pleasure to interact with. Hope I manage to give back a little with this project.
